Yenkaine priority set ki thi

It appears you've provided several images of text from what looks like a document outlining "On Time Delivery & On Quality Delivery," "Client Satisfaction," and "Learning Hours Group Reco."

From what I can gather across the images, the priorities seem to be:

1. On Time Delivery & On Quality Delivery: * Planning and Organization: Plan tasks in advance to avoid last-minute rush and delays. * Efficient Time Management: Prioritize tasks to ensure nothing is left pending and deadlines are met. * Continuous Improvement: Regularly review and improve processes to enhance the quality of deliverables. * Customer Satisfaction: Ensure the work meets or exceeds the expectations of the client or team.

2. Client Satisfaction (OTACE): * Regular Feedback and Updates: Keep clients informed at every stage of the project. * Consistency in Performance: Meet or exceed client expectations regularly. * Effective communication and collaboration: Maintain transparency about deadlines and potential delays.

3. Learning Hours Group Reco: 40 to 60 (for Personal Effectiveness) * Mandatory Training * Sustainability ERD Essentials pathway * Technology: * Learn skills with Engineering Academy * DevOps Essentials Pathway * Gen AI Basics / Guidelines & Ethics pathways

There's also a section about contributing to market leadership position & performance target (Revenue/Gross Margining/DOR) and Group Synergies/Client Impact.

It seems like a comprehensive list of priorities covering project delivery, client relationships, and personal/team development.

Help me to do that

Okay, I understand. You're looking for help to phrase "Overall Comments on Priorities" and "Overall Comments on Skills Maturity" based on the text provided. It seems like you want to highlight contributions and show that "koi kami na dikhe plus point hi dike hike increment bhi lage" (no shortcomings should be visible, only positive points should appear, leading to an increment).

Let's break down the key points from your text and phrase them into positive comments.

Here are some draft comments you can adapt:

Overall Comments on Priorities:

"I have actively contributed to enhancing our technical infrastructure and operational efficiency by managing the JDK 21 upgrade, pipeline enhancements, and setting up critical monitoring tools like Azure Montiotr, Prometheus, and Grafana Loki. Furthermore, I've been instrumental in establishing the new project capacity, including initial environment setup for DEV & QA K8s clusters, K8s manifests, and Windows batch scripts, ensuring robust backend and frontend operations. My focus has been on continuous improvement, including the ongoing migration from Bitbucket to GitHub and Bamboo to GitHub Actions for CI/CD, which will streamline our development processes significantly. These efforts have directly supported our goals for On-Time Delivery and Quality Delivery, ensuring our systems are robust and performant."

Overall Comments on Skills Maturity / Employee Comment: What is the level of contribution this year?

"My skills maturity has significantly advanced this year through hands-on involvement in several key initiatives. I've demonstrated strong capabilities in managing complex upgrades and setting up critical infrastructure components, showcasing a proactive approach to adopting new technologies like K8s. My engagement with client-facing POCs (e.g., New Agent POC) and active participation in JIRA & sprint activities highlight my commitment to effective communication and collaboration. I've also taken the initiative to address issues by raising tickets for Azure issues and connecting with Ictosoft. The successful execution of these tasks, particularly in complex K8s clusters, reflects my growing expertise and dedication to exceeding expectations. I consistently strive to apply best practices and ensure high-quality outcomes in all my contributions, demonstrating an extraordinary level of effort and commitment."

"actively contributed to enhancing..."

"instrumental in establishing..."

"focus has been on continuous improvement..."

"directly supported our goals..."

"skills maturity has significantly advanced..."
